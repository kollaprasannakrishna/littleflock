                    Naperville, Aurora and other west suburbs of Chicago. We are not affiliated to any denomination.
                    We firmly believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, and constantly seek His grace to keep us
                    rooted and build us in His word. We adhere to the vision of first century, who were looking unto the Lord Jesus
                    Christ for help as they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread,
                    and in prayers (Acts 2:42).</p>
