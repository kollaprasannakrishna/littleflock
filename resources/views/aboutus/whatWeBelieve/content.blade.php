                    We believe in one triune God – God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit,
                    eternally existing and have precisely the same nature, attributes, and perfections,
                    and worthy of precisely the same homage, confidence and obedience

                        We believe in Biblical Inerrancy, which means bible is a living Word and entire bible is the
                        Truth, and there is no error. We believe that all scripture is inspired by God, and is profitable
                        for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness: That the man of God
                        may be competent, equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

                        We believe that man was originally created in the image of God to worship
                        and serve the God in innocence. But, because of his voluntary disobedience, he fell down
                        from fellowship with Holy God thus becoming subject to the power of the evil one. We believe
                        that this fallen nature was depicted in Bible in many terms viz., “sin” (Rom 6:12, 14), “flesh” (Gal 5:17), “lust” (James 1:14, 1 John 2:16), etc.,
